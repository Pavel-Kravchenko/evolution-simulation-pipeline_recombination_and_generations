# evolution-simulation-pipeline_recombination_and_generations
This is the evolution simulator to compute populations with all possible ranges of recombination, generations and mutations. It creates sets of sequences with different evolution parameters

This pipeline is the part of bioengineering and bioinformatics faculty coursework


## Before you start

The pipeline is available only for <i>Linux</i> users </br>
Make sure that you have installed all components:
<ul>
<li>Python 3.6 or upper https://www.python.org/
<li>Biopython 1.70 or upper http://biopython.org/
<li>R and R-Studio with basic packages https://www.rstudio.com/
</ul>


## Getting started

### Installation

First of all you have to ```clone``` this directory</br></br>
```git clone https://github.com/Pavel-Kravchenko/evolution-simulation-pipeline_recombination_and_generations/```</br></br>
Then ```cd``` in evolution-simulation-pipeline_Ne_and_generations</br></br>
```cd evolution-simulation-pipeline_recombination_and_generations```</br></br>
And ```tar``` Species_files.tar.gz</br></br>
```tar -xvf evolution-simulation-pipeline_recombination_and_generations.tar.gz```</br></br>
Command ```ls -1``` and make sure that you have all files in your directory
```
alignment_reader_script.py
evolution-simulation-pipeline_recombination_and_generations.tar.gz
heatmap_df_maker.py
README.md
R_plot.R
run_script.sh
simulation_script.py
```
Now you are ready to start.
To check, command 
```bash run_script.sh``` and wait until the program is completed.
It has to create ``./Files`` directory and archive it to ``archive.tar``
You are expected to receive such demo results in ./Files:

```

```
For create your populations and analyze them, change necessary parameters in run_script.sh and heatmap_df_maker.py
